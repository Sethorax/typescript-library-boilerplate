# typescript-library-boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a starting point for TypeScript libraries with preconfigured module bundling via `rollup`, tests via `jest` and various other little helpers like `prettier`, `commitizen`, `ts-lint` and **Travis CI** and **Coveralls support**.

## Usage

Just clone this repository and change `mylib.ts` in something more suitable for your library in `package.json` and in the `src` folder.
